                            Information retrieval (IR) systems have experienced extraordinary progress fueled by deep learning in the past decade. The success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns in the collected data for prediction; however, the critical transition from model prediction to the final decision making in IR is far from trivial. What distinguishes IR from other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing is that it interacts directly with users and inherently involves making many complex decisions to satisfy information and user needs -- the mere prediction of relevance or classification of content is not enough. There are many desirable properties besides accuracy that IR systems should possess, such as robustness (stability), potential negative impact, long-term utility, as well as the satisfaction of various parties involved. Historically, there have always been gaps between pattern prediction and making decisions, and many of the algorithmic approaches make oversimplified assumptions about human behavior. As more and more IR tasks can accurately be solved by deep learning, the major research and production efforts have shifted to the pattern recognition side of machine learning. This leads to the aforementioned gaps being further enlarged. Ultimately, this hinders overall progress since it is unknown to which degree the improvements in relevance prediction and pattern recognition actually improve real-world decision making and complex tasks.

                        <p class="large text-muted">
                            In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of research projects approaching the gaps via techniques such as causal inference, bandits, and reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, decision making for modern IR stands out as a novel scientific discipline where causal modelling and exploration-exploitation solutions, if practical, only answer part of the questions. On the other hand, decision making has also been long-studied by other domains such as marketing, economy, and some branches of statistics. Also, for IR systems, innovations in decision making must be accompanied by sufficient infrastructural support.

                            Most IR systems consist of pattern recognition and decision-making. In the past decade, the flourishing of deep learning has provided IR with unprecedented opportunities for mining complex signals from collected data, shifting the public focus vastly toward the pattern recognition end. However, making predictions based on the discovered patterns is merely the first step toward information retrieval: the agent must strategically decide how to leverage the knowledge to maximize the various utilities of different parties. This workshop aims to identify and solve the critical challenges of transitioning pattern recognition to decision making in IR, where existing attempts focus primarily on A/B testing and sequential decision-making with reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-armed bandits (MAB). 

                        </p>

                        <p class="large text-muted">
                            We wish to unite researchers and practitioners from various backgrounds to identify the emerging challenges, discover the connections from various domains, and study promising solutions of decision making for modern information retrieval systems. We note that the decision making strategy may impact either the immediate performance and long-term development of real-world productions. We also pay special attention to the role of human involvement in practical decision making, and how novel applications and business incentives can be motivated by emerging technologies in such as A/B testing, RL and MAB.

                        <h4>Search engines and recommender systems have become the dominant matchmaker for a wide range of human endeavors -- from online retail to finding romantic partners. Consequently, they carry substantial power in shaping markets and allocating opportunity to the participants. In this talk, I will discuss exogenous and endogenous reasons for why naively applying machine learning in these systems can result in ranking policies that fail to be fair in the short term, or that lead to undesirable market dynamics in the long term. Exogenous reasons often manifest themselves as biases in the training data, which then get reflected in the learned ranking policy and lead to rich-get-richer dynamics. But even when trained with unbiased data, reasons endogenous to the algorithms can lead to unfair or undesirable allocation of opportunity. To overcome these challenges, I will present new ranking algorithms that directly address both endogenous and exogenous unfairness.

                        Most recommender systems are subject to the strong feedback loop created by learning from historical user-item interaction data.  It creates the rich gets richer phenomenon where head contents are getting more and more exposure while tail and fresh contents are not discovered. At the same time, it pigeonholes users to contents they are already familiar with and creates myopic recommendations. The talk will discuss how exploration can help break away from the feedback loop and move toward optimizing long term user experience on recommendation platforms.  We examine the roles of exploration in recommender systems from three angles: 1) system exploration to surface fresh/tail recommendations based on users' known interests; 2) user exploration to identify unknown user interests or introduce users to new interests; and 3) online exploration to utilize real-time user feedback to reduce extrapolation errors in performing system and user exploration. We discuss the challenges in measurements and optimization in different types of exploration, and propose initial solutions. We showcase how each aspect of exploration contributes to the long term user experience through offline and live experiments on industrial recommendation platforms. We hope this talk can inspire more follow up work in understanding and improving exploration in recommender systems.

                        <h4>
                        In the past 30 years, we have seen online advertising invented, evolved, and matured into a trillion-dollar market. The decision making problem for online advertising has never been an easy one: there are challenges including data sparsity, system complexity, robustness & stability, long-term utility, fairness, as well as the three-body problem between shopper, advertiser, and platform. Instead of describing what we have achieved today, this talk will focus on an illustration of those fruitful but challenging areas in which academia and industry communities are inventing new technologies every day.

                            <h4>
                            We establish a general optimization framework for the design of automated bidding agent in dynamic online marketplaces. It optimizes solely for the buyer’s interest and is agnostic to the auction mechanism imposed by the seller. As a result, the framework allows, for instance, the joint optimization of a group of ads across multiple platforms each running its own auction format. Bidding strategy derived from this framework automatically guarantees the optimality of budget allocation across ad units and platforms. Common constraints such as budget delivery schedule, return on investments and guaranteed results, directly translates to additional parameters in the bidding formula. We share practical learnings of bidding agent implementation in the LinkedIn ad marketplace based on this framework.
