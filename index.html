                            Information retrieval (IR) systems have experienced extraordinary progress fueled by deep learning in the past decade. The success of neural networks has brought tremendous opportunities to model highly complex patterns in the collected data for prediction; however, the critical transition from model prediction to the final decision making in IR is far from trivial. What distinguishes IR from other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing is that it interacts directly with users and inherently involves making many complex decisions to satisfy information and user needs -- the mere prediction of relevance or classification of content is not enough. There are many desirable properties besides accuracy that IR systems should possess, such as robustness (stability), potential negative impact, long-term utility, as well as the satisfaction of various parties involved. Historically, there have always been gaps between pattern prediction and making decisions, and many of the algorithmic approaches make oversimplified assumptions about human behavior. As more and more IR tasks can accurately be solved by deep learning, the major research and production efforts have shifted to the pattern recognition side of machine learning. This leads to the aforementioned gaps being further enlarged. Ultimately, this hinders overall progress since it is unknown to which degree the improvements in relevance prediction and pattern recognition actually improve real-world decision making and complex tasks.

                        <p class="large text-muted">
                            In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of research projects approaching the gaps via techniques such as causal inference, bandits, and reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, decision making for modern IR stands out as a novel scientific discipline where causal modelling and exploration-exploitation solutions, if practical, only answer part of the questions. On the other hand, decision making has also been long-studied by other domains such as marketing, economy, and some branches of statistics. Also, for IR systems, innovations in decision making must be accompanied by sufficient infrastructural support.

                            Most IR systems can be described by a pattern recognition stage and a decision-making stage. In the past decade, the flourishing of deep learning has provided IR with unprecedented opportunities for mining complex signals from collected data, shifting the public focus vastly toward the pattern recognition end. However, making predictions based on the discovered patterns is merely the first step toward information retrieval: the agent must strategically decide how to leverage the predictions to maximize the various utilities of different parties. Proposed in a timely manner, this workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry for the critical challenges of transitioning the pattern recognition outcome to effective decision making in IR. Crucially, the decision making strategy will have a considerable impact on the immediate performance and long-term development of real-world web search and data mining applications.

                            We wish to unite researchers and practitioners from various backgrounds to identify the emerging challenges, discover the connections from various domains, and study promising solutions of decision making for modern infromation retrieval systems. We note that the decision making strategy may impact either the immediate performance and long-term development of real-world web search and data mining applications. We also pay special attention to the role of human involvement in practical decision making, and motivate novel applications and business incentives.
